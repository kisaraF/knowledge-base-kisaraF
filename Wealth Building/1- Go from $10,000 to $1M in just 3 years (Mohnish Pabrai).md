## Safe & Wise Investing

If you have $10K and want to turn it into $1M in 3 years. First invest all in an index fund like Berkshire Hathway. Then use the time and skills you have to research companies, find anomalies etc. Then take 10%-15% of that index fund and invest that on this anomaly. 

Warren Buffet has made a lot of purchase, invest decisions in his career and he tells that only 12 has made significant changes. The idea is that good, life-changing investment decisions are not happening very often. But when they do, you have to take the chance. To do that you need to keep your money in an index fund without losing it to inflation and keep researching and studying anomalies to make investing decisions.


## First order thinking vs Second order thinking

First order thinking is more like what to do now. In the video Mohnish uses the Crude Oil Ship company example of his. When the recession was happening in the market, and when on the paper, the company was losing money, Mohnish researched deep into how the company is financed, break-even happens and all the ways it could go bankrupt, he couldn't find anything significant to make the company bankrupt and actually even selling it's assets would keep the company afloat break-even. So he invested 10% of his money on it and doubled it in a few months.

Second order thinking is more like what's next. Mohnish did the research, studied and made the investment and when the stock prices were going up he doubled it. But he failed to see where it could potentially go in the future because the company went onto worth 300X per share in a few more years.


## Find anomalies

Warren Buffet used a company summaries book known as "Moody's Manual" back in '50s to gain knowledge on companies. He would read every single page, actually find market data and see how much the company makes. If the company makes $25 per share and in the manual it's $60 per share, there is an anomaly. Then he would study it more, and make his decisions.

## Simple is the best form of intelligence

If you can't explain the thesis of your picked stock in 4-5 sentences to a 10 year old or if you can't do the math of stocks without Excel and complicated tools, it usually signals an automatic pass into not doing it. Einstein has mentioned 4 levels of intelligence. Smart, Intelligent, Genius, Smart.
