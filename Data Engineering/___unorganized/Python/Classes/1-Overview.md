When programs grow in size and when you need to represent real world objects in code, the native data structures like strings, lists, etc. are not going to be sufficient. Hence, we would need out own data structures and a way to model these objects of real world into code. That's where OOP shines in.

An object has,
1. Attributes- State of the object/ internal data
2. Methods- Behavior of an object. Also can be instructions that alters the state by modifying attributes

Then what is a __Class__?
- A class is the blueprint for defining those new objects. 

Instances
- Instances are the objects created by a class
- Instantiating is the process of creating an instance from a class
