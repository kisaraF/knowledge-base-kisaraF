This is a comprehensive doc about all the different and interesting git commands I find useful.

### 1. Delete a branch

`git branch -d <branch_name>`

- You have to switch to a different branch in order to delete the target brnach as git won't allow you to delete the current branch you are in.

### 2. Rename a branch

`git branch -m <branch_name>`
