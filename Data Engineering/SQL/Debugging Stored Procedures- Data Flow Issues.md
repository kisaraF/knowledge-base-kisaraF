# Stored Procedure Debugging: Data Flow Issues

## Prompt:

There are different ways that data can be flowed in SQL queries. The case scenario is that I have a stored procedure which processes data from 20+ tables and there are joins, CTEs, etc. So, the same data that I process everyday gets processed without errors in the end file (After processing all these 18 tables, there will be 1 big end table which all processed data will be inserted into). 

Now the next thing is, I had to test a new data dump, and it started giving me errors in the end table. Some columns were null: the reason was new data dump didn't have any data for that particular landing table and when it goes through joins the nulls occurred. Then some values were different. IF the original distinct values of a file should be between 1-5, these new values range is different, therefore, when where condition filters applied and the tables were joined on these new values, the exact output is not achieved. 

Can you think of all the possible ways that data flow could result in incorrect data (data flow will happen through joins and through direct retrieving from the table but final processed data is not what expected), given the SQL query logic is on point and doesn't need changes. The point is to think of ways how the source file data that were inserted into the 18 landing tables are inaccurate.

## Answer:

Certainly! When dealing with SQL queries that involve multiple tables, joins, and data processing, there are several potential issues that can arise from the source data itself, leading to incorrect results in the final processed table. Here are some possible ways that data flow could result in incorrect data, even if the SQL query logic is sound:

1. **Missing Data in Source Files**:
- If the new data dump does not include records for certain landing tables, this can lead to null values in the final output. For example, if a join relies on a key that is missing in one of the tables, the result will contain nulls for those columns.

2. **Data Type Mismatches**:
- If the data types in the new data dump differ from those expected in the landing tables (e.g., a string instead of an integer), this can lead to conversion errors or unexpected behavior during joins and filtering.

3. **Inconsistent Data Formats**:
- Variations in data formats (e.g., date formats, string casing) can cause issues when performing joins or comparisons. For instance, if one table has dates in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format and another in 'DD/MM/YYYY', this can lead to mismatches.

4. **Unexpected Null Values**:
- If the new data dump contains unexpected null values in key columns that are used for joins, this can result in incomplete or incorrect data in the final output.

5. **Data Integrity Issues**:
- If the new data dump has integrity issues, such as duplicate records or foreign key violations, this can lead to unexpected results when the data is processed.

6. **Changes in Business Logic**:
- If the business rules or logic that govern the data have changed (e.g., valid ranges for certain fields), and the new data dump reflects these changes, it may not align with the existing SQL logic, leading to discrepancies.

7. **Incorrect Data Ranges**:
- As you mentioned, if the expected distinct values for a column are between 1-5, but the new data dump has values outside this range, it can lead to filtering issues and incorrect results.

8. **Data Duplication**:
- If the new data dump contains duplicate records that were not present in the previous data, this can lead to inflated counts or incorrect aggregations in the final output.

9. **Join Conditions Not Met**:
- If the new data dump has values that do not meet the join conditions (e.g., missing keys or mismatched values), this can lead to incomplete data in the final output.

10. **Data Transformation Errors**:
- If there are any transformations applied to the data during the loading process (e.g., data cleansing, normalization) that are not correctly implemented, this can lead to inaccuracies in the final output.

11. **Source System Changes**:
- If the source systems that generate the data have undergone changes (e.g., schema changes, changes in data generation processes), this can affect the quality and structure of the data being loaded into the landing tables.

12. **Timing Issues**:
- If the data dump is taken at a different time than expected (e.g., during a system update or maintenance), it may not reflect the most current or accurate data.

To mitigate these issues, it is essential to implement robust data validation and cleansing processes before loading data into the landing tables. Additionally, thorough testing and monitoring of the data flow can help identify and address potential discrepancies early in the process.
