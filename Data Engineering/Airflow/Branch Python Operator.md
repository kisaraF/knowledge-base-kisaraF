## Prompt

I have a DAG in airflow and following is a task I have:

```
load_date = str((datetime.now()).strftime('%H%M'))

def dag_selector():
    return_data = []
    if load_date >= '1000' and  load_date <= '1250':
        return_data.append('dag_new_1')
        return_data.append('dag_new_2')
        return return_data
    else :
        return_data.append('dag_old_1')
        return_data.append('dag_old_2')
        return return_data
```

This checks the time now and select the correct strings

These strings which will be appended to the return_data array are task names in the same DAG. So, what we are trying to accomplish is, if the DAG run time is within the minutes defined in the condition, to make only the selected DAGs (using the strings passed to the array in the function) to run from the task flow defined like below:

```
start >>  dag_selector  >> [dag_old_1, dag_old_2] >> end
start >> dag_selector >> [dag_new_1, dag_new_2] >> end
```

My question is, let's say the dag_old_1 and dag_old_2 was selected from the dag_selector function, how does Airflow determine to which ETL flow to be run from the two given here?

## Answer

In Apache Airflow, you can control the flow of tasks based on the output of a function like `dag_selector` by using the `BranchPythonOperator`. This operator allows you to dynamically choose which downstream tasks to execute based on the result of a Python function.

Here's how you can implement this in your DAG:

1. Define the Branching Logic: Use the `BranchPythonOperator` to call your `dag_selector` function. This operator will determine which tasks to execute based on the return value of the function.

2. Set Up the DAG: Create the tasks for `dag_old_1`, `dag_old_2`, `dag_new_1`, and `dag_new_2`, and then set up the branching logic to direct the flow based on the output of `dag_selector`.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can structure your DAG:

```
from datetime import datetime
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python_operator import BranchPythonOperator, PythonOperator
from airflow.operators.dummy_operator import DummyOperator

# Define the load_date variable
load_date = str((datetime.now()).strftime('%H%M'))

def dag_selector():
    return_data = []
    if load_date >= '1000' and load_date <= '1250':
        return 'dag_new'  # Return the task group for new DAGs
    else:
        return 'dag_old'  # Return the task group for old DAGs

# Define the tasks for the old DAG
def dag_old_1():
    print("Running dag_old_1")

def dag_old_2():
    print("Running dag_old_2")

# Define the tasks for the new DAG
def dag_new_1():
    print("Running dag_new_1")

def dag_new_2():
    print("Running dag_new_2")

# Create the DAG
with DAG('dynamic_dag_selection', start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval='@daily', catchup=False) as dag:

    start = DummyOperator(task_id='start')

    # Branching task
    branch_task = BranchPythonOperator(
        task_id='dag_selector',
        python_callable=dag_selector,
        provide_context=True
    )

    # Define the tasks for old DAG
    old_task_1 = PythonOperator(task_id='dag_old_1', python_callable=dag_old_1)
    old_task_2 = PythonOperator(task_id='dag_old_2', python_callable=dag_old_2)

    # Define the tasks for new DAG
    new_task_1 = PythonOperator(task_id='dag_new_1', python_callable=dag_new_1)
    new_task_2 = PythonOperator(task_id='dag_new_2', python_callable=dag_new_2)

    end = DummyOperator(task_id='end')

    # Set up the task dependencies
    start >> branch_task

    # Define the branching logic
    branch_task >> [old_task_1, old_task_2]  # If old tasks are selected
    branch_task >> [new_task_1, new_task_2]  # If new tasks are selected

    # End task
    old_task_1 >> end
    old_task_2 >> end
    new_task_1 >> end
    new_task_2 >> end

```
Explanation:

- BranchPythonOperator: This operator calls the `dag_selector` function, which returns either `'dag_old'` or `'dag_new'`.
- Task Dependencies: The tasks for the old and new DAGs are set up to run based on the output of the `dag_selector`.
- DummyOperator: Used to represent the start and end of the DAG flow.

Important Note:

- The `dag_selector` function should return the task IDs of the tasks you want to execute. In this example, I used simple strings to represent the task groups. You can modify the logic to return the specific task IDs based on your requirements.
- Ensure that the task IDs returned by the `dag_selector` function match the task IDs defined in your DAG.

This setup allows Airflow to dynamically determine which ETL flow to run based on the current time, as defined in your `dag_selector` function.

## Prompt

So dag_selector being a branchpythonoperator will automatically select the task names (from the selected strings) as the determined tasks and ETL glow to be run right?

## Answer

Yes, that's correct! When you use the `BranchPythonOperator`, it will automatically determine which downstream tasks to execute based on the return value of the `dag_selector` function. Here's how it works in detail:

1. Branching Logic: The `dag_selector` function is called when the `BranchPythonOperator` executes. This function evaluates the current time and returns a specific task ID (or IDs) based on your defined logic.

2. Task Selection: The return value of the `dag_selector` function indicates which downstream tasks should be executed. For example, if the function returns `'dag_new'`, Airflow will execute the tasks associated with that branch (e.g., `dag_new_1` and `dag_new_2`). If it returns `'dag_old'`, it will execute the tasks associated with that branch (e.g., `dag_old_1` and `dag_old_2`).

3. Automatic Execution: Airflow handles the execution flow automatically. The tasks that are not selected will be skipped, and the execution will proceed to the end task (in this case, the `end` task).

Example of How It Works:

- If the current time is between `1000` and `1250`, the `dag_selector` function will return `'dag_new'`, and Airflow will execute `dag_new_1` and `dag_new_2`.
- If the current time is outside that range, the function will return `'dag_old'`, and Airflow will execute `dag_old_1` and `dag_old_2`.

Important Considerations:

- Return Value: Ensure that the return value of the `dag_selector` function matches the task IDs of the tasks you want to execute. You can return a single task ID or a list of task IDs, depending on your branching logic.
- Task Dependencies: Make sure to set up the task dependencies correctly so that the flow of execution is as intended. The `BranchPythonOperator` should point to the tasks that are conditionally executed based on its output.

Example Code Adjustment:

If you want to return specific task IDs based on the condition, you can modify the `dag_selector` function to return the task IDs directly:

```
def dag_selector():
    if load_date >= '1000' and load_date <= '1250':
        return 'dag_new'  # This should match the task IDs for new tasks
    else:
        return 'dag_old'  # This should match the task IDs for old tasks

```
In your DAG setup, ensure that the task IDs returned by `dag_selector` correspond to the actual task IDs defined in your DAG. This way, Airflow will automatically manage the execution flow based on the current time and the logic defined in your `dag_selector` function.
